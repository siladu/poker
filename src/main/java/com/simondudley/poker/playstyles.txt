Temperaments in Poker

TAG - Tight Aggressive
 - bets when have good hands
 - Raise 3x the big blind
 - fold with bad hands
 - recommended style
 - Dan Harrington

LAG - this is playable too, depending on the other players
TP and LP are playing sub-optimally

                        Aggressive            Passive
                        (bets often)  |  (bets infrequently)
------------------------------------------------------------
Tight (Calls seldom) |    TAG         |   TP "Weak"

Loose (Calls Often)  |    LAG         |   Calling Machine

* effective stack = most chips you can lose
* M ratio = effective stack / sum of the blinds and the antes
 - how many rounds of poker you can survive if you fold every single hand
 - A high M means the player can afford to wait a high number of rounds before making a move.
 - The concept applies primarily in tournament poker; in a cash game, a player can in principle manipulate his M at will, simply by purchasing more chips.
 - A player with a low M must act soon or be weakened by the inability to force other players to fold with aggressive raises.
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-ratio
* Effective M = M * how shorthanded your table is === number of 10-handed table you can survive
 - reduces your M proportionally, because you're playing the blinds
 - informs you when to make your moves

Last player to raise has to show hands first

STARTING HANDS
--------------
* A+J off-suit VS 6+6 has 46% chance of winning ('a coin flip')
 - to win, need A, J or a straight
 - A+J suited is 48% due to flush

* K+Q off-suit VS 8+8 has 46% as well
 - still have two over-cards against opponents pair

* If opponent has A+A, what do you want?
 - Ideally A+A
 - Not K+K!!
 - 5+6 suited is next best - 23%
   - suited connectors have a stronger chance of a straight or flush than other cards
   - 5+6 because 2,3,4 and 7,8,9 will not help A+A get straight

Horror hands: K+10-off, KA?, KJ, AQ, JJ
 - Ace with weak kicker
 - A+T off-suit should be played as a stealing hand, don't get too involved
    - Beaten by A+J,Q,K and J+J+
    - fold or
    - raise to limit your post flop opponents
 - careful when against aggressive players as they will reraise

* Don't raise on A+10 under the gun (first to act)??
* Beginners need to focus on starting hands, but real skill comes post-flop

Underrated hands:
 - suited 1-gappers: 7+9
 - to some extent suited 2-gappers
 - 9+10 suited

BLUFFING
---------
* Attack signs of weakness
* Don't bluff when there are too many other players
* Bluff to represent a hand.
* Continuation bet
 - if you raise pre-flop, should continue to raise post-flop
 - raising pre-flop, then check is a sign of weakness
 - c-bet LESS often against 3 or more opponents
 - c-bet LESS often against tricky opponent (they may test with a reraise)
 - c-bet MORE often if opponent is TIGHT
 - c-bet MORE often if the board is dry (low unsuited, less connected cards)


BETTING
-------
* Betting should have a purpose, usually one of:
 - gaining value
 - protected your hand
   - e.g. you think you're ahead but might not be if more cards are shown
 - bluffing opponents out
 - gaining information
   - see how your opponent will react

* Value betting
 - induce call from your opponent to extract chips from them
 - don't go so high that they fold

* Bet size
 - personal to the player
 - players tend to bet more on better hands, so if you play with them long enough you can find out what they're bet sizing means
 - 60% of pot (post-flop) to protect hand and gain value

* Over-bet - betting large amount compared to the pot, usually a bet that is greater than the pot size
 - can be used to find out what the opponent will do

* Folding
 - 'Art of folding' in this example below is H defining his hand so that he could easily define V's hand.
 Hero: KQo, Villain: 9c8s (big blind)
 H: small raise to 475
 V: Call as its small raise and he's defending his blind
 Flop: 8TJ clubs
  - V has pair of 8's and open ended straight flush draw
  - H has two overcards and just a straight draw
 V: checks
 H: checked behind V
   - sensed that he could well have hit the flop
   - didn't think he could get away with betting the flop as a bluff
   - wanted to have a chance to catch the straight
 Turn: 9 spades
   - Now V has a pair and open ended straight flush draw
   - H has straight
   - V obviously checks
   - What is right bet size for H?
   - H: bets 1000 (big bet, 80% of pot)
     - if he is going to draw to a club, wants to make him pays big price for it
 River: 9 hearts
   - V has Full House
   - V: checks
   - H thinks there's a good chance V has a queen, so he might just call a bet
   - H: overbets to >pot
     - decides to 'polarize his range'
     - indicates he either has a really strong hand or is bluffing
     - How V reacts to this will give away how strong he hand it
     - if V has Q, it's not strong enough to check-raise
     - if V re-raises, then he thinks he can beat a good hand
     - makes the next decision easier
    * V: raises to 10000
     - either he's raising with a good hand or is a bluff (but the draw makes this extremely unlikely
     - If H had raised e.g. 1400 instead of the over-bet, V might have raised 5000 and the decision to fold would have been hard.


BETTING 2
---------
* Bet sizes are relative to pot
* half pot is small
* 2/3 - 3/4 is medium
* > 3/4 is large bet

WHEN TO SMALL BET:
* CBETs should be kept same size to make bluffing indistinguishable
* On a very dry board
 - it's unlikely your opponents have big hands
 - eliminates one of the most important reasons to bet big if you're in the same situation on the river
 - small bet is enough to give you the info you need
 - allows you to gain this info and fold without losing too many chips
* On the river (info or value bet)
 - elicit a call when you think you're ahead

WHEN TO LARGE BET:
* pre-flop is larger due to having a minimum bet size of 2-3 times the big blind
* on dangerous boards
 - lots of draws possible
 - even more so if you have several opponents and have a strong hand
 - most drawing players will fold under these circumstances
* when you have a monster
* when bluffing
* large bet signals either a monster or bluff
 - forces opponent to make a big decision

Use MEDIUM sized bets for all other situations

BLOCKER BET
* Small bet on the river when you're OUT OF POSITION
 - designed to deter your opponent from betting
 - if you check, they might place a large bet
 - a small bet might make a bluffing opponent fold
 - otherwise it might make them call
 - they'll only raise if they have a hand

OVERBET
* Usually larger than the total pot
* Used to confuse opponent
* polarise hand

UNDERBET
* Small in relation to pot
* Used to extract value from a person who is perceived to have a weak hand
